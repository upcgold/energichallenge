2a. Storage is the on chain area where a contract can store data persistently between contract calls.
2b. Memory is cheaper than storage gas wise, and data stored here are only accessible during contract execution.
2c. Stack is non persistent storage area that has a capacity of ~1024 items, functions similar to memory.  Stack is where function parameters are pushed.  Too many will trigger stack exception.


3. This is a piece of code that is run to set conditions on the execution of a function.  A function's definition can specify a modifier, and then if the modifier's conditions are met, the function will be executed, else it will not be executed.
